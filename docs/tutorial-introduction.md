# Introduction

S is for Store is a very simple, yet capable, state container.  The entire API consists of only a handful of function calls.  You will be able to learn it in no time at all.

In this tutorial you will add S is for Store to a simple React app.  This app will display facts about major world cities.  You will use S is for Store to make HTTP requests, add the data from those requests to the store, and connect the store to a react component.

## TypeScript

This tutorial, as well as S is for Store, was written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).  TypeScript is rapidly [growing in popularity](https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/) and is becoming a tool that is important to many developers.  Because of this, S is for Store strives to provide first class support for TypeScript.

S is for Store does not require TypeScript and works perfectly well with standard JavaScript.  The syntax for TypeScript is not remarkably different from JavaScript.  Even if you are unfamiliar TypeScript we believe you will still be able to follow this tutorial.
